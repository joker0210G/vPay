# Contributing to vPay

First off, thank you for considering contributing to vPay! It's people like you that make vPay such a great tool.

## How Can I Contribute?

There are many ways you can contribute to the vPay project. We use GitHub issue templates to help streamline the reporting and suggestion process. When you create a new issue on GitHub, you should be prompted to choose a template.

### Reporting Bugs
If you encounter a bug, please help us by reporting it. To file a bug report, please open an issue on GitHub. Include:
- A clear and descriptive title.
- Steps to reproduce the bug.
- What you expected to happen.
- What actually happened.
- Your environment details (e.g., Flutter version, device OS).

When reporting a bug, please use our Bug Report template. GitHub should offer this template automatically when you click "New Issue", or you can access it directly [here](./.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md).

### Suggesting Enhancements
If you have an idea for a new feature or an improvement to an existing one, please open an issue on GitHub. Describe your idea clearly and explain why it would be beneficial to vPay users.

For feature requests or enhancements, please use our Feature Request template. GitHub should offer this template automatically, or you can find it [here](./.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md). We also have a template for [General Feedback](./.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feedback.md).
